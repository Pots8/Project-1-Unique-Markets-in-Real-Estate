## Project Description/Outline


## Research questions to answer

What factors impact the difference between List Price and Sell Price, and where are the trends often “bucked”? Why could this be?

By looking for correlations between various factors, some relating to location (such as crime or school rating) and some relating to the specific listing (such as Month and days on the market), and the difference between List Price and Sale Price of residences, we hope to find places where the correlation is unexpectedly broken, and theorize as to why.

## Datasets to be used
Zillow or Redfin: Sale-to-List ratio
Zillow or Redfin: Month
Zillow or Redfin: Days on Market
U.S. Census: Commute Times
FBI (or elsewhere?) : Crime
GreatSchools: School rating

## Rough breakdown of tasks
